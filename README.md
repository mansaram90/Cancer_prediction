# Cancer_prediction
This project trains and evaluates machine learning models to predict a binary `diagnosis` outcome using common risk and lifestyle features. It includes a simple training workflow, model evaluation (classification report + confusion matrix), feature importance, and saving the trained Random Forest model for later use.
